## How do I navigate this site?
Just like any other site, you can follow the navbar up top. The navbar is set to sticky top:0, so it will follow you no
matter how far down you scroll!
## How do I access the projects?
On my portfolio page, you'll be greeted by two divs. Each one has a link with an arrow and these will take you to a project.
## "This page changes depending on it's width"?
Yep! Just change the width of your browser window if you're on pc. If you're on mobile however, you'll only see the mobile version.
-Note that some little things might change too, so pay careful attention to the text in Project2!
## "This page changes depending on your light or dark mode preference"?
You bet! If you are on a Windows 11 operating system, you can go to Settings->Personalization->Colours->Choose your mode,
to switch between light mode and dark mode.
