                <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
                <P>I am a web development student who enjoys playing with colours and shapes to make my websites unique. I am Canadian, and out of all the colours out there, I have no favourites. They are all equally useful in design.</P>

                <h3>MY HOBBIES</h3>
                <P>My hobbies involve various art forms, but most notably drawing both digitally and traditionally. I also love reading, poetry, world-building and super nerdy things like science, Pok&#233;mon and D&D.</P>

                <h3>MY GOALS</h3>
                <P>Although web-design is not one of my long-term goals, the creative side of the tech industry is still where I lay my sights. That and creating graphic novels, getting a paying job, a house,.. the usual.<P>
